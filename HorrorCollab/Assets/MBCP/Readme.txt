Military Bunker Construction Pack
=================================

Thank you for purchasing the asset!

Most importantly, please use linear color space and deferred rendering path when working with the asset pack!


Render settings
===============
Since there is no 'exterior', make sure to use a Solid black color clear flag for the rendering camera to avoid artifacts.

Elevator
========
Hardcoded for demonstration purposes only. Easy to code because the elevator follows the concept of the entire level design.
One floor is 4 units (4 meters) high. Simply give Elevator.cs a value from your respective class, and it will move it accordingly.
There are 2 animators - one on the shaft, one on the elevator itself. They both move the 2 doors. (Elevator's animation triggers the shaft door's animator event
a little delayed, so they look more realistic by not opening together.)

Doors
=====
Doors are animated already, the script adjusts the lod model's door accordingly (only LOD0 moves). The animator is attached too LOD0 door object itself.

Conflicts when importing the package to a project?
==================================================
Everything not related to the 3D art content can easily be deleted from the DEMO folder (Standard assets and Editor folders).
